# BenJamin's Vocalizer - Advanced
Left 4 Dead 2 Custom Vocalizer with character dialogue,  character selector, versus callouts, and admin & bot commands, including item spawner and map selector. Inspired by Doktor Haus's Vocalizer and C2's VOX Vocalizer.

**AS OF RECENT L4D2 UPDATE, PRE-PACKAGED ADDON SCRIPTS NO LONGER WORK. FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW TO COPY THE CFG FILE YOURSELF.**

If you receive this error **"exec: couldn't exec benjaminsvocalizer"**, you will need to download or copy the [**benjaminsvocalizer.cfg**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notazed/BenJamins-Vocalizer/Advanced/BenJamin's%20Vocalizer%20-%20Advanced/cfg/benjaminsvocalizer.cfg) file in this repo to your **"...\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg"** folder as a **.CFG** file (not just a .txt file).

You will also want to create a new blank **"autoexec.cfg"** file in that same folder (if you don't already have one) and add a new line with **"exec benjaminsvocalizer.cfg"**, again saving the file as a **".CFG"**. This way, the game automatically looks for the autoexec file and runs the vocalizer script on startup every time.

#### TL:DR Instructions:
1. Subscribe from the workshop
2. Close your game
3. Copy the [**benjaminsvocalizer.cfg**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notazed/BenJamins-Vocalizer/Advanced/BenJamin's%20Vocalizer%20-%20Advanced/cfg/benjaminsvocalizer.cfg) file into your **"...\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg"** folder (save as benjaminsvocalizer.cfg NOT autoexec.cfg.txt)
4. Create an **autoexec.cfg** file in the same folder (if you don't already have one) and add a new line **"exec benjaminsvocalizer.cfg"** (save as autoexec.cfg NOT autoexec.cfg.txt)
5. Start your game and GL&HF! ;)

If you have any problems or suggestions, feel free to message me in the comments on the workshop page and I'll help you out. You can also make your own radials using mine as a template. Just make sure you know what you're doing. ;) And as always, GLHF!
